INTRODUCTION:

This is a data analysis project, based on the data provided on "https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Traffic-Violations/4mse-ku6q".

This project is built on Jupyter notebook.
It uses Python programming, Pandas library and Matplotlib.

DATASET SUMMARY:

This dataset contains traffic violation information from all electronic traffic violations issued in the County.

TRAFFIC VIOLATION ANALYSIS:

The first notebook contains basic information about the traffic violations with maps. The work helps in understanding Pandas Library, using the jupyter notebook, using matplotlib to plot graphs and extract infrormations.

TRAFFIC VIOLATION STORY:

The second part of the project helps in implementing the pandas in a better way, to extract useful data from the dataset given.

A new column was created by searching keywords in the "Description" column of the dataset, which broadly classified the violation to 8 different types.

subsequent studies and plots helps in understanding the "violation types" impact on accident, gender, races etc.
